# RedCrucible Tool Manifest
#
# Each tool entry defines an offensive .NET assembly that the API can
# obfuscate and serve. The `assembly_path` is relative to the configured
# assembly cache directory.
#
# To add a new tool:
#   1. Add an entry here
#   2. Place the pre-compiled base assembly in the cache directory
#   3. Restart the API (or hit the reload endpoint)
